# create-ai-e2e Quick Start

![Quick Start Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/123456.svg)

> **Get from zero to green E2E tests in under 60 seconds.**

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ‚â• 20** installed
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- (Optional) **Anthropic API key** for AI assertions
  ```bash
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...  
  ```

## 1. Install the CLI

Install directly via npx (no global install needed):

```bash
npx create-ai-e2e init
```

This will:

- Install Playwright and download browser binaries
- Create a `playwright.config.ts` in your project root

---

## 2. Scan your codebase

Detect routes/components in your `src/` folder:

```bash
npx create-ai-e2e scan src/ [--vue] [--json]
```

- `--vue`: scan as a Vue project (default is React)
- `--json`: output raw JSON for automation

You should see:

```
üîç Found routes:
  ‚Ä¢ /
  ‚Ä¢ /about
  ‚Ä¢ /products
```

---

## 3. Generate tests

Generate Playwright smoke specs for each route:

```bash
# Basic smoke tests:
npx create-ai-e2e gen

# With Claude 3.7 AI assertions:
npx create-ai-e2e gen --ai
```  

Your `tests/` folder will now contain files like `home.spec.ts`, `about.spec.ts`, etc.

---

## 4. Run your tests

Kick off Playwright:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

All tests should pass (üíö) on first run.

---

## GitHub Actions Integration

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated E2E testing. The workflow:

1. Runs on push to main branch and pull requests
2. Uses Node.js 20
3. Installs dependencies and Playwright browsers
4. Runs tests with HTML reporter
5. Uploads test results as artifacts

To use the workflow in your project:

1. Copy the `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` file to your project
2. Update the working directory if needed
3. Push to trigger the workflow

Example workflow status badge:
```markdown

```

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- If you hit permission errors on global linking, skip linking and run via:
  ```bash
  node ./dist/cli.js <command>
  ```
- For projects with custom router paths, add a quick `.e2eignore` file to exclude files.
- To disable AI mode by default, unset the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.
- If tests fail in CI, check the uploaded artifacts for detailed reports.
